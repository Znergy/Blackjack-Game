## Why Blackjack?
* First, I love playing blackjack. 
* Second, I thought this would be the perfect first time javaScript project.
* Third, blackjack uses a lot of logic to operate and that's fun to work on.

## What else am I planning on doing?
* I would like to add a registration page, that links to a database. Allowing each player to log in and out, be given a certain amount of chips, and add some cool functionality.
* I want to create a responsive layout that will scale, using bootstrap.

## Why Blackjack?
* First, I love playing blackjack. 
* Second, I thought this would be the perfect first time javaScript project.
* Third, blackjack uses a lot of logic to operate and that's fun to work on.

-
## What have I learned?
* Plan ahead, by thinking through what the application will do before touching the keys.
* Focus on code reusability, to stay organized and write cleaner, easier to maintain code.
* When you solve problems as they arise, you end up with a hell of a mess, towards the end.

## What else am I planning on doing?
* I would like to add a registration page, that links to a database. Allowing each player to log in and out, be given a certain amount of chips, and add some cool functionality.
* I want to create a responsive layout that will scale, using bootstrap.
